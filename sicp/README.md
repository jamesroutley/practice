# SICP

Solutions to the problem sets in the 'Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs'

## Install

These problem sets were written using the `sicp` [collections](http://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/index.html) for [racket](https://racket-lang.org/).

Racket and `sicp` collections can be installed on macOS with:

```
brew cask install racket
raco setup
raco pkg install sicp
```

`sicp` can be used by starting each file with:

```
#lang sicp
```

An `sicp` REPL can be used by running:

```
racket -l sicp --repl
```
